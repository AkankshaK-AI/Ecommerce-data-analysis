# Ecommerce-data-prep

The Ecommerce analysis contains data from a particular eCommerce website which sells products in various categories; such as electronics, apparels, accessories etc.

We have data in 2 categories:- 
1) Transaction and time data:- Transaction time and value info for a particular housing society on a particular ecommerce website
2) Sales data:- Sales data across products and categories

We need to do the basic data prep in order to be able to analyze the data going forward.
